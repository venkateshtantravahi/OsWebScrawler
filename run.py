This script serves as the entry point for the Flask application.

It imports the 'app' and 'db' objects from the 'app' package, which are essential for starting and running the Flask application. 
The 'app' object represents the Flask application instance, while 'db' is the SQLAlchemy database instance.

To run the application, this script should be executed. When it's run, it will start the Flask web server and initialize the database, making the application ready to receive and respond to HTTP requests.

Ensure that all necessary configurations and initializations are completed in the 'app' package before running this script.
